Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a highly influential and beloved action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. Released in 2004, it is the fifth main installment in the iconic Grand Theft Auto series. The game is known for its massive open world, compelling story, and innovative gameplay features that set a new standard for the genre.

### Plot Summary

The story is set in the fictional state of San Andreas, which is based on California and Nevada, in the year 1992. You play as Carl "CJ" Johnson, who returns to his hometown of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles) after a five-year absence in Liberty City (based on New York City) to attend his mother's funeral.

Upon his return, CJ finds his old street gang, the Grove Street Families, in disarray, and his family and friends are falling apart. To make matters worse, two corrupt cops, Officer Frank Tenpenny (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and Officer Eddie Pulaski, frame him for a homicide. Forced to go on the run and clear his name, CJ's journey takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, including the cities of San Fierro (based on San Francisco) and Las Venturas (based on Las Vegas). Along the way, he must rebuild his gang, confront enemies, and uncover the truth behind his mother's death and the conspiracy against him.

### Key Gameplay Features

* **Vast Open World:** San Andreas was revolutionary for its time due to its sheer scale. The map is huge, encompassing three distinct cities and a large rural area with deserts, forests, and small towns, all of which are seamlessly connected.
* **RPG Elements and Character Customization:** Unlike previous GTA games, San Andreas introduced a number of role-playing game elements. Players could customize CJ's appearance, from clothing and haircuts to tattoos. They could also affect his physical attributes by eating, working out at gyms, and practicing skills like driving, shooting, and bicycling. A character's physical state (fat, skinny, muscular) directly affected their abilities and stamina.
* **Vehicle Variety:** The game offered an immense number of vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, bicycles, boats, helicopters, and planes. Many could also be customized with features like hydraulics and nitrous oxide engines.
* **Gang Warfare:** A key part of the gameplay involves gang warfare. Players could recruit members of the Grove Street Families and take over territories from rival gangs, defending them from attacks.

### Legacy

* **Critical and Commercial Success:** *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* was a massive commercial success and received universal critical acclaim for its story, setting, voice acting, and ambitious scope. It is the best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time.
* **Cultural Impact:** The game's narrative, which touched on real-life events like the 1992 Los Angeles riots, the crack epidemic, and the Rampart scandal, resonated with many players. Its memorable characters, iconic soundtrack, and immense replayability have cemented its status as one of the most beloved and influential video games ever made.
