<h3><font color=#F0F0F0 face=Elephant><p>Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) is a popular online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by Krafton. It is the Indian version of PUBG Mobile. The game was released on July 2, 2021, for Android devices and on August 18, 2021, for iOS devices.

### Gameplay

BGMI is a "last man standing" game where up to 100 players parachute onto a large map to scavenge for weapons, vehicles, and equipment. The goal is to be the last player or team alive. The playable area of the map shrinks over time, forcing players into closer quarters and increasing the likelihood of encounters.

### Game Modes

BGMI offers a variety of game modes to cater to different playstyles:

* **Classic Mode:** This is the main battle royale mode where up to 100 players compete. Matches take place on various maps, including Erangel, Miramar, Vikendi, Sanhok, Karakin, Livik, and Nusa.
* **Arena Mode:** Designed for fast-paced, close-quarters combat, Arena Mode includes sub-modes like:
    * **Team Deathmatch (TDM):** Two teams compete to reach a set number of eliminations.
    * **Domination:** Teams fight for control over specific bases on the map.
    * **Gun Game:** Players start with a basic weapon and progress to new weapons with each kill.
* **Arcade Mode:** This mode offers quick and action-packed matches with different sub-modes like Quick Match, Sniper Training, and War.
* **EvoGround Mode:** This mode features experimental gameplay with unique mechanics and objectives, such as special abilities or respawning.
* **Custom Rooms:** Players can create private matches to play with friends and customize game settings.
* **Training Grounds & Cheer Park:** These modes are for practice and social interaction. Players can test weapons, practice skills, and engage in mini-games.

### Key Features

* **Regular Updates:** Krafton consistently releases new updates with themed modes, collaborations, and fresh content. These updates often introduce new maps, weapons, and in-game events.
* **Esports:** BGMI has a thriving esports scene in India, with official tournaments like the BGMI India Series (BGIS) and BGMI Pro Series (BMPS).
* **Customization:** Players can customize their characters with a wide range of outfits, gun skins, and other cosmetic items, which can be acquired through the in-game store, Royale Pass, or by completing missions.
* **Royale Pass:** The Royale Pass is a tiered reward system that gives players access to exclusive in-game items as they level up by playing the game.
