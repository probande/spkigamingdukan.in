<h3><font color=maroon face=Times New Roman><p>Among Us is a popular online multiplayer social deduction game developed by the American game studio Innersloth. It was released in 2018 and gained a massive surge in popularity in 2020. The game is available on a variety of platforms, including PC, mobile devices, and consoles.

### Gameplay and Objective

The game is set in a space-themed environment where 4 to 15 players are assigned one of two roles:

* **Crewmates:** The majority of players are Crewmates. Their objective is to complete various tasks around the map, which are presented as simple mini-games or puzzles. They must also identify and vote out the Impostors. Crewmates win by either finishing all tasks or by successfully ejecting all Impostors.
* **Impostors:** A smaller number of players are secretly assigned as Impostors. Their goal is to kill the Crewmates and sabotage the ship without being caught. Impostors cannot do tasks but can use unique abilities like using vents to move quickly and sabotaging critical systems to cause chaos. They win if the number of Impostors equals the number of Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage is not fixed in time.

The core of the game is social deduction. Players must communicate and use their observation skills to figure out who is lying and who is telling the truth. When a dead body is reported or an emergency meeting is called, all players meet to discuss and vote on who they suspect is the Impostor. The player with the most votes is ejected from the game.
