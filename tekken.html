<h3><font color=red face=Times New Roman><p> Tekken 3 is a legendary fighting game developed and published by Namco. Released in arcades in 1997 and on the PlayStation in 1998, it is widely considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time and is often cited as a pinnacle of the genre.

### Gameplay and Innovations

Tekken 3 built upon the success of its predecessors by refining the core gameplay while introducing significant new features. The biggest change was the addition of the "side-step" mechanic, which allowed characters to move into the background or foreground to dodge attacks, adding a new dimension of strategy and depth to the combat. The game also featured smoother animations, more detailed character models, and a faster pace than the previous installments.

The PlayStation port of Tekken 3 was particularly acclaimed for its content. It included additional game modes that have since become staples of the series, such as:

* **Tekken Force:** A beat 'em up mode where players fight through waves of enemies.
* **Tekken Ball:** A unique mini-game that resembles a violent game of volleyball.

### Plot

The story of Tekken 3 takes place 19 years after the events of Tekken 2. Heihachi Mishima, who survived the last tournament, has been building the Tekken Force to protect his company, the Mishima Zaibatsu. However, he discovers that his soldiers are being attacked by a mysterious creature known as Ogre, also referred to as the "God of Fighting."

Heihachi organizes the King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 to lure Ogre out into the open. The main protagonist of this installment is Jin Kazama, the son of Kazuya Mishima and Jun Kazama. Jin seeks to avenge his mother, who he believes was killed by Ogre. Heihachi takes Jin under his wing, training him in the Mishima fighting style, all the while intending to use him as bait to capture Ogre and harness its power.

### Character Roster

Tekken 3 introduced a mostly new cast of characters, many of whom have become fan favorites and series mainstays. Key newcomers included:

* **Jin Kazama:** The new protagonist and grandson of Heihachi.
* **Ling Xiaoyu:** A high school student who fights with a unique style of Chinese martial arts.
* **Hwoarang:** A Tae Kwon Do fighter and rival to Jin.
* **Eddy Gordo:** A master of Capoeira, a martial art known for its acrobatic and fluid movements.
* **Bryan Fury:** A cyborg kickboxer with a sinister personality.

Some fan-favorite characters from previous games also returned, including **Heihachi Mishima**, **Paul Phoenix**, **Lei Wulong**, and **Nina Williams**. The character roster also featured some quirky and memorable additions, like the dinosaur **Gon** and the training dummy **Mokujin**.
