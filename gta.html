<h3><font color=#47761E face=Times New Roman><p>Grand Theft Auto V, commonly known as GTA V, is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It's the fifth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series and is widely considered a landmark in open-world gaming. The game was first released in 2013 and has since been made available on multiple generations of gaming consoles and PC.

### Story and Setting

The game's single-player story is set in the fictional state of San Andreas, which is a satirical take on Southern California, and the city of Los Santos, a version of Los Angeles. The narrative is a complex tale that intertwines the lives of three distinct protagonists:

* **Michael De Santa:** A retired, wealthy bank robber living an unhappy life in witness protection with his dysfunctional family.
* **Franklin Clinton:** A young street hustler from the hood who is looking to escape his old life and make something more of himself.
* **Trevor Philips:** A volatile, chaotic, and psychopathic career criminal and Michael's former partner.

The story follows these three characters as they are brought together to commit a series of high-stakes heists and survive the pressures from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. The plot is known for its satirical commentary on American society, pop culture, and the pursuit of the "American Dream."

### Gameplay

GTA V is a third-person (and first-person in its enhanced versions) action-adventure game with an expansive open world. Players can explore the city of Los Santos and the surrounding countryside of Blaine County, which is filled with diverse activities, side missions, and secrets.

Key gameplay features include:

* **Character Switching:** One of the game's most innovative features is the ability to switch between the three protagonists at almost any time. This allows players to experience the story from different perspectives and use each character's unique abilities.
* **Heist Missions:** The heists are a central part of the storyline. These are multi-part missions that require careful planning, and players can choose their approach and hire a crew to assist them, which affects the mission's outcome.
* **Vehicles and Weapons:** The game offers a massive selection of vehicles, from cars and bikes to planes and boats, each with its own handling characteristics. Players also have access to a wide arsenal of weapons that can be customized with various attachments.
* **Special Abilities:** Each protagonist has a special ability that can be activated for a limited time:
    * **Michael:** Can slow down time during a gunfight.
    * **Franklin:** Can slow down time while driving.
    * **Trevor:** Can enter a rage mode that increases his damage and reduces the damage he takes.

### GTA Online

In addition to the single-player campaign, GTA V includes a robust online multiplayer mode called **GTA Online**. This mode allows up to 30 players to explore the world of Los Santos together, creating their own criminal empires. Players can complete heists, races, and various other missions with friends or other players. GTA Online has received continuous updates since its launch, adding new content, vehicles, weapons, and businesses for players to acquire.
